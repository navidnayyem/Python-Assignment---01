    "# 8.\tRecall that if s is a string, then s.find( ' a ' ) will find the location of the first a in s . The problem is that it does not find the location of every a. Write a function called findall that given a string and a single character, returns a list containing all of the locations of that character in the string. It should return an empty list if there are no occurrences of the character in the string."
